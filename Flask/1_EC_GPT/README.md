## Notes: ##
- The execution worked functionally correct after ChatGPTs error fix. 
- ChatGPTs solution was similar to the solution from the Flask documentation. The only difference was that ChatGPT suggested to put a check in both the `update` and `delete` function, while the Flask documentation suggested to put a check in the `get_post` function, which is more efficient. The solution from the Flask documentation can be found in `SOLUTION.md`.
